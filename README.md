# Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how

In this workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at recent art controversies. Students will then create a self-portrait with the help from their fellow students using content from the web. Finally, students print, cut and paste their online portrait into a physical zine. turn this content into a physical zine share content from their archive for the class to create group portraits. This last gesture asks students to not only entrust one another with their content but trust individual voices can speak for others and the group.  

## Homework (15 minutes)
Take 15 minutes to watch this [video](https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/58dabbab91d237b4148aa34f) about the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz's painting from the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Then read this [article](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parker-bright-paris-protest-1227947) about Parker Bright who protested Dana's painting and was the subject of a Neïl Beloufa work at the Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris.<br>

Think about who. From what position was Dana creating? Then whom. How did this effect Parker and Neïl and then Parker again? How did technology play a part? Not just in the distribution but the making of art.

## Warm-up (30 minutes)

<b>Introductions</b><br>
Take a Hello sticker. Write down a password that you use. Don't show it to anyone. Talk about how you picked your password without reveling it. Explain what you like and don’t like about it. Now give away your Hello sticker to someone else. Stick your classmates' password to your chest. This is your name for the rest of the class.<br>

<b>Appropriation</b> <br>
Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts (literary, visual, musical, performing, and net art). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp. (Wikipedia)<br>

In the digital age we're all appropriation artists. Like Pig-Pen from Peanuts. Each moment he steps or shakes his head – Pig-pen generates more visible dust. He moves through the world inscribing the contemporary into his digital cloud, adding the dirt of the day to his already thickly layered historical record. His critics – the entire cast of Peanuts – often accuse him of wallowing in his dirt, of taking hedonistic pleasure in his condition. As an outcast, he assumes the role of the trickster, a figure who, defying normative community-based behavioral standards, is the keeper of a database of deep and secret knowledge. His cloud is a haze, an ambience, a network that can’t be defined by specific boundaries. He is at once physical and ephemeral. (Kenneth Goldsmith)<br>

<b>Zines</b><br>
A zine is a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via photocopier. Zines are either the product of a single person, or of a very small group and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation. Dissidents and members of socially marginalized groups have published their own opinions in leaflet and pamphlet form for as long as such technology has been available. The concept of zines had an ancestor in the amateur press movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, which would in its turn cross-pollinate with the subculture of science fiction fandom in the 1930s. The popular graphic-style associated with zines is influenced artistically and politically by the subcultures of Dada, Fluxus, Surrealism and Situationism. (Wikipedia)<br><br>

<b>Self-portraits</b><br>
Open a web browser. Clear your browser history. Think of a website, page, or post that you like. That represents who you are. Navigate to it. Stop. Everyone rotate one seat. You have one minute to review what's on the browser and click on one thing. Stop. Rotate sears again. One minute to review and click one thing. Stop. Repeat above until you're back at your computer.

Your browser history and anything on each of these pages is now raw material for your zine. Review it, collect text, images, video, whatever you want to use for your zine. Post these assests to a feed (Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, etc.). 

Print your feeds using Eyebeam's black and white laser printer. Use sissors and glue to arrange your material onto three letter size sheets. When finished, copy them on the black and white printer. Fold them in half. Collate them. Bind them with the stapler.
