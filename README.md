# Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how

In this half-day workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice â€” looking at a few key artists and authors who use the Internet as raw material. Students will then create a self-portrait using content from their emails, texts, apps, and feeds. Finally, students will share content from their archive for the class to create group portraits. This last gesture asks students to not only entrust one another with their content but trust individual voices can speak for others and the group.
