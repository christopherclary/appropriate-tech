# Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how

In this half-day workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at a few key artists and authors who use the Internet as raw material. Students will then create a self-portrait using content from their emails, texts, apps, and feeds. Finally, students will share content from their archive for the class to create group portraits. This last gesture asks students to not only entrust one another with their content but trust individual voices can speak for others and the group. 


## Overview (15 minutes)

<b>Homework</b> <br>
Please watch this [video](https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/58dabbab91d237b4148aa34f) about the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz's painting from the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Then read this [article](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parker-bright-paris-protest-1227947) about Parker Bright who protested Dana's painting and was the subject of a Neïl Beloufa work at the Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris.

<b>Concepts</b> <br>
Appropriation vs privacy <br>
Artistic freedom vs social justice  <br>
Programmer vs user

<b>Questions</b> <br>
We will discuss your thoughts about the painting in relation to who is speaking for whom and how. From what position was Dana creating? Or Parker? Or Neïl? What positions are fixed, where is identity fluid, and would there have been another way for Dana to appropriate the Emmett Til photograph? What technologies were used here? How was the tech influencial?

## Work (60 minutes)

<b>Warm-up</b> <br>
In a group, have one person choose two behavior rules. Distribute one rule to all but one of the other members of the group, and the other to only one. Make it discreet so you do not know who got the majority rule and who got the minority. In a chat room, have everyone type and act according to the rule they were given. See if the majority can identify the minority and vice versa, and if they can determine each other's rules.


<b>Zines</b> <br>
Clear your browser history. Open a web browser. Navigate to a web page that represents you. Everyone rotate one seat. You have one minute to review the web page. Click on one thing. Rotate seats again, review the page, and click on one thing. Repeat until you're back to your computer.

Review all the pages in your broswer history. This is the material you will use to create a self-portrait zine. Collect text, images, whatever you want to use for your zine. Post these assets to a feed (Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, etc.). 

Print your feeds to the Eyebeam black and white laser printer. Use sissors and glue to arrange your material onto three letter size sheets. When finished, copy them on the black and white printer. Fold them in half. Collate them. Bind them with the stapler.
