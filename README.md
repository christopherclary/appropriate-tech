# Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how

In this half-day workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at a few key artists and authors who use the Internet as raw material. Students will then create a self-portrait using content from their emails, texts, apps, and feeds. Finally, students will share content from their archive for the class to create group portraits. This last gesture asks students to not only entrust one another with their content but trust individual voices can speak for others and the group.

## Warm-up Exercise
In a group, have one person choose two behavior rules. Distribute one rule to all but one of the other members of the group, and the other to only one. Make it discreet so you do not know who got the majority rule and who got the minority. In a chat room, have everyone type and act according to the rule they were given. See if the majority can identify the minority and vice versa, and if they can determine each other's rules.
