# Appropriate Tech: who can speak for whom and how

In this workshop students will use their online personas to create art about themselves and their classmates. First we'll discuss appropriation versus privacy and artistic freedom versus social justice — looking at recent art controversies. Students will then create a self-portrait with the help from their fellow students using content from the web. Finally, students print, cut and paste their online portrait into a physical zine. turn this content into a physical zine share content from their archive for the class to create group portraits. This last gesture asks students to not only entrust one another with their content but trust individual voices can speak for others and the group.  

## Homework (15 minutes)
Take 15 minutes to watch this [video](https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/58dabbab91d237b4148aa34f) about the controversy surrounding Dana Schutz's painting from the 2017 Whitney Biennial. Then read this [article](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parker-bright-paris-protest-1227947) about Parker Bright who protested Dana's painting and was the subject of a Neïl Beloufa work at the Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris.<br>

Think about who. From what position was Dana creating? Then whom. How did this effect Parker and Neïl and then Parker again? How did technology play a part? Not just in the distribution but the making of art.

## Work (65 minutes)

<b>Self-portraits</b><br>
Open a web browser. Clear your browser history. Think of a website, page, or post that you like. That represents who you are. Navigate to it. Stop. Everyone rotate one seat. You have one minute to review what's on the browser and click on one thing. Stop. Rotate sears again. One minute to review and click one thing. Stop. Repeat above until you're back at your computer.

Your browser history and anything on each of these pages is now raw material for your zine. Review it, collect text, images, video, whatever you want to use for your zine. Post these assests to a feed (Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, etc.). 

Print your feeds using Eyebeam's black and white laser printer. Use sissors and glue to arrange your material onto three letter size sheets. When finished, copy them on the black and white printer. Fold them in half. Collate them. Bind them with the stapler.
